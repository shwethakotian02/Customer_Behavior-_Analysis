# Customer_Behavior-_Analysis
Customer Behavior Analysis project using Python, SQL, and Power BI to analyze shopping patterns and customer preferences. Python was used for data cleaning and analysis, PostgreSQL for data storage and querying, and Power BI for interactive dashboards. The project provides insights into purchasing trends and discount impact.

### Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The main objective is to understand how customers purchase products, identify patterns in spending, and present insights in a clear and visual way that can help with business decisions.

### Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related information such as demographics, purchase details, and product categories.
It was initially explored and cleaned using Python before being stored in a relational database for further analysis.

### Tools Used
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. SQL (PostgreSQL)
3. Power BI
4. Jupyter Notebook
5. pgAdmin
6. Microsoft Excel

### Project Workflow
1. Loaded the dataset using Python
2. Cleaned and prepared the data
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Wrote SQL queries to analyze customer behavior
5. Stored and retrieved data from PostgreSQL
6. Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI
7. Created a report and presentation summarizing the insights

### Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard highlights key metrics such as customer spending trends, popular product categories, and overall purchasing behavior.
It is designed to be simple, interactive, and easy to understand.

### Key Insights
* Identified customer purchasing patterns
* Analyzed category-wise sales performance
* Highlighted trends that can support data-driven decisions

### How to Run
* Clone the repository
